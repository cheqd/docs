# Network-wide Software Upgrades

## Context

Updates to the ledger code running on cheqd mainnet/testnet is voted in via governance proposals on-chain for "breaking" software changes.

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to define our software release versions. The latest software version running on chain is in the **v1.x.x** family. Any new release versions that bump only the minor/fix version digits (the second and the third part of release version numbers) is intended to be **compatible** within the family and **does not require** an on-chain upgrade proposal to be made.

## Latest on-chain software upgrade

## Creating a new software upgrade proposal

Network-wide software upgrades are typically initiated by the core development team behind the cheqd project. The process followed for the network upgrade is defined in our [guide on creating a Software Upgrade proposal](propose-software-upgrade.md) via network governance.

## Legacy software upgrade proposals

This section lists **previous** software upgrade proposals which are no longer valid for the active mainnet/testnet.
