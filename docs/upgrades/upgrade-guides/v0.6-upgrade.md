# Overview

This document offers the information and instructions required for node operators complete an upgrade with a fresh installation.

We decided to remove the debian package as an installtion artifact and use our own installation tool. The main reason for this is to help our current and future node operators join the cheqd network or complete an upgrade in a more intuitive, simpler and less time intensive way.

For this upgrade from `0.5.0` to `0.6.0` there are 2 possible scenario:

- upgrade by installing Cosmovisor
- upgrade only `cheqd-noded` binary.

[Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor) is a tool from the `cosmos-sdk` team which is able to make an upgrade in a full-auto mode. It can download and exchange binary without any actions from a node operator. Beginning with version `0.6.0`, and with all subsequent versions, we will leverage Cosmosvisor as a tool to handling our upgrade process.

For [more information about interactive installer please see this documentation](../../setup-and-configure/README.md).
You will find answers to common questions within this document, however of course feel free to reach out to the team on Slack or Discord.

## Upgrade with installing Cosmovisor

As the installation and setting up the Cosmovisor can be difficult, and requires some additional steps for setting up the `systemd` service, we injected all this steps into our interactive installer.

The flow for installtion is:

### Stop the `systemd` service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cheqd-noded
```

Make sure that it was definitely stopped by using:

```bash
systemctl status cheqd-noded
```

The output should be:

```text
● cheqd-noded.service - Service for running cheqd-node daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cheqd-noded.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead) since Thu 2022-07-07 12:31:12 UTC; 27s ago
       Docs: https://docs.cheqd.io/node
    Process: 13427 ExecStart=/usr/bin/cheqd-noded start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 13427 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```

the main focus here: `Active: inactive (dead)`

### Remove current debian package

```bash
sudo apt remove cheqd-node
```

### Download interactive installer and run it

```bash
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/interactive_installer/installer/installer.py
sudo python3 installer.py
```

### The next answers are needed for upgrading `cheqd-noded` binary with the Cosmovisor installation

**IMPORTANT** For running an `Upgrade scenario` you'll be required to setup a current home directory for a `cheqd` user as an answer on question `Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:`. This is because the upgrade scenario will only be used if this directory exists.

```text
1) v0.5.0
2) v0.6.0
3) v0.6.0-rc2
4) v0.6.0-rc1
5) v0.5.0-rc2
Choose list option number above to select version of cheqd-node to install [default: 1]:
2
Set the path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:

Existing cheqd-node configuration folder detected. Do you want to upgrade an existing cheqd-node installation? (yes/no) [default: no]:
y
*********  INFO: Installing cheqd-node with Cosmovisor allows for automatic unattended upgrades for valid software upgrade proposals.
Install cheqd-noded using Cosmovisor? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
y
Overwrite existing configuration for cheqd-node logging? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
y
Overwrite existing configuration for logrotate? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
y
```

**WARNING** Please make sure that you answered `yes` for questions about overwriting existing configuration. It's very important when making a new installation with Cosmovisor.

### Start new `systemd` service

```bash
sudo systemctl start cheqd-cosmovisor
```

## Upgrade only binary

If you are updating a current installation the next steps can be used:

### Stop the `systemd` service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cheqd-noded
```

and make sure that it was really stopped by:

```bash
systemctl status cheqd-noded
```

Output should be like:

```text
● cheqd-noded.service - Service for running cheqd-node daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cheqd-noded.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead) since Thu 2022-07-07 12:31:12 UTC; 27s ago
       Docs: https://docs.cheqd.io/node
    Process: 13427 ExecStart=/usr/bin/cheqd-noded start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 13427 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```

the main focus here: `Active: inactive (dead)`

### Remove current debian package

```bash
sudo apt remove cheqd-node
```

### Download interactive installer and run it

```bash
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/interactive_installer/installer/installer.py
sudo python3 installer.py
```

### Answers for interactive installer

**IMPORTANT** For running an `Upgrade scenario` you'll be required to setup a current home directory for a `cheqd` user as an answer on question `Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:`. This is because the upgrade scenario will only be used if this directory exists.

```text
1) v0.5.0
2) v0.6.0
3) v0.6.0-rc2
4) v0.6.0-rc1
5) v0.5.0-rc2
Choose list option number above to select version of cheqd-node to install [default: 1]:
2
Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:

Existing cheqd-node configuration folder detected. Do you want to upgrade an existing cheqd-node installation? (yes/no) [default: no]:
y
*********  INFO: Installing cheqd-node with Cosmovisor allows for automatic unattended upgrades for valid software upgrade proposals.
Install cheqd-noded using Cosmovisor? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
n
Overwrite existing systemd configuration for cheqd-node? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
n
Overwrite existing configuration for cheqd-node logging? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
n
Overwrite existing configuration for logrotate? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
n
```

**WARNING**. IF you are keeping just standalone a `cheqd-noded`, without Cosmovisor, it's crucial you keep your `systemd` service files without overwriting them. Please make sure that your answers were `no`.

### Similar to what was previously in place, for starting the service only the next command is needed

```bash
sudo systemctl start cheqd-noded
```
